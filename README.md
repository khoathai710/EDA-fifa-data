# Exploratory Data Analysis on FIFA Data

## Introduction
This project explores FIFA player data using statistical techniques (A/B Testing, ANOVA) and machine learning models in R.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various attributes related to FIFA players, including:
- Player ratings
- Positions
- Physical attributes
- Performance statistics

## Tools & Libraries
The following R libraries are used for analysis:
- **tidyverse**: Data manipulation and visualization
- **ggplot2**: Data visualization
- **dplyr**: Data wrangling

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Transforming categorical variables

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Data visualization
- Correlation analysis

### Statistical Analysis
- A/B testing to compare groups
- ANOVA to analyze variance between groups

### Machine Learning Models
- **Logistic Regression**: Classification tasks.Ex: reputation, position
- **Linear Regression**: Predicting numerical values. Ex: potential, overall
- Performed statistical evaluations to assess the reliability of the regression model, including:
  - Checking the linearity of each feature
  - Constructing confidence intervals for each coefficient
  - Detecting outliers
  - Testing for multicollinearity


## Results & Insights
- Key findings from statistical tests
- Performance metrics of machine learning models
- Visualizations supporting insights

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth analysis of FIFA data using statistical and machine learning techniques in R. The insights gained offer a deeper understanding of player performance and attributes.
